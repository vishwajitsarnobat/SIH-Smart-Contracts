# sih_smart_contract

(put a tick besides ones that are done. V besides one vishwajit will do, Y besides ones yateen will do)
#to do now:

1. dispute resolution and way for government ids to be stored and added
2. test/debug and check parameters and logic

#to do in far future:

1. way for government or someone to monitor contracts that have applicants but both parties have not agreed
   and time limited exceeded, so funds are stuck there
2. efficient fetching and scalability with regards to gas fees. eg: off chain storage and paging
3. time period in which both parties have to agree. probably not possible in contract but in backend.
4. punishing farmers for applying but not agreeing. possible solutions: charge cancellation fees to farmers  
   when applying.
5. advanced contract changing from applicant notes. issue is with exploitation.
6. fractional contracting.
7. way to automatically close contracts/applicant based on produce in farmers possession after a deal or if
   for some reason produce is lower or higher, then way to manage that too
